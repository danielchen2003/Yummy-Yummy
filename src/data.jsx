    instructions:
      "We made this chicken recipe over and over last summer, and we'll do it again this year. It starts with a marinade of tangy tamarind purée, brown sugar, cumin, red pepper flakes, and fish sauce; at the end, don't skip the crunchy onion and fresh cilantro on top. Unfortunately, these are so good you might not want to share. Looking for another easy dish to serve with these wings? How about a big platter of this low-cook chaat?",

Serve with a corn salad and/or creamy slaw, and dish up an ice cream icebox cake for dessert.",

      "We know we promised that this wouldn't just be a list of margarita recipes. But it's worth remembering—on National Tequila Day and every day—that the classic margarita is yours for tinkering. Some bartenders recommend 2 oz. tequila, 1 oz. fresh lime juice, and ¾ oz. Cointreau or other orange liqueur. Others dial down the tequila to 1½ oz., and do ¾ oz. each Cointreau and lime, plus ¼ ounce simple syrup. If you prefer to drink yours up, just strain into a coupe.",
